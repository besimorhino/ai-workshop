# About
This is a collection of notebooks to help people wanting to begin an AI journey. It assumes that you are starting with next to no knowledge of Jupyter, python, or AI.

If you have any suggestions on how to improve this, please do let me know. 

Note: for best results, I suggest using Google's Colab service. I've included a link at the top of each workbook to make getting started as easy as possible. All workbooks will function at the free tier. If you want to run these notebooks locally or in anohter service and you run into issues, please let me know, I'll do what I can to help.

# Intro
The workbooks are grouped by topic and increase in difficulty as you go through each section. Each workbook is 100% stand alone. You do NOT need to complete a prior workbook to do one that interests you. This means you are free to jump around and work on these labs as you choose. However, if you do not have skills or knowledge to understand what is happening in a workbook, there are prior ones you can go back to and experiment with until you are comfortable.

2. Intro to Python (optional)

## Embeddings 
3. [Space is meaning](space_approximates_meaning_vectors.ipynb)
4. [Tokens](Tokens.ipynb)
5. Embeddings

## Vectorization of data
6. Text vectorization
7. [Audio vectorization](audio_vectorize.ipynb)
8. [Image vectorization](image_vectorize_demo.ipynb)
